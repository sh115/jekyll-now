## What did you do this past week?
This week I continue to do the project 2 with my partner and was able to turned it in on time. However, there was some mistakes on my part and a file we forgot to fix, so it ended up being late. I really hope I will not get this kind of mistakes and penalty in the future. Other than the projects, the class material got little more tricky but it was still interesting to learn a new language. I am still not so comfortable with the python, but I am so much better after doing two projects and also excited to learn different languages later on in the class.

## What's in your way?
As always, my obstacle is really myself. I have not been able to use the time efficiently recently, so I wish I could manage time better next week. 
    
## What will you do next week?
I will be meeting new groups to do the project 3, so I am waiting for that group to be decided and start the project as soon as possible.

   
## Pick or Tip of the week
I read this article which talks about how Apple has established the free coding class for their language, Swift, but he is arguing this is for their marketing purpose and teaching the swift is a terrible idea for the beginners. It was interesting to read that Apple is doing this for their marketing purpose to me. I personally think C is a great language to learn, but not sure if it is suitable languages to be picked up for the beginners. However, I learned some valualbe stuffs from C, so I would definitely recommend C after knowing one or two other languages.
