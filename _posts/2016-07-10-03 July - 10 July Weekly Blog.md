## What did you do this past week?
This week we only had one class due to the 4th of July and the final exam for the summer one. It was really nice to take a break from the class and be able to rest without thinking about going to the class. The project is still really confusing to me, and having trouble on how to start and what to do to create dynamic websites. It is very overwhelming to me how to use all these tools together in right way. So far, I only looked at the samples of codes for different languages and trying to figure out how to connect each other. However, I am stuck with local server problem even before an attempt to play with Flask, Python, Javascript, and AngularJS. 

## What's in your way?
All these new tools are really hard to use all together, so I am really struggling a lot from just learning and and actually implementing them into one thing.

## What will you do next week?
I will probably do the same thing. Doing project and going to class and work. But it is already July, so I am planning to clean up my apartment and trying to get all the miscellaneous stuffs done before I leave.

## Pick or Tip of the week
This article talks about MIT researchers have created a 3D printing that could print out the thousands of hair-like-structures. This would normally take over an hour to do, but the researchers were able to create a new software called “Cillia” which reduced the time to under a few minutes. Being able to efficiently create a detailed work of 3D printing is very fascinating and interesting enough to read how Cillia could provide in near future.
