## What did you do this past week?
I spent this week submitting and doing the projects. The project submission took me  a long time to understand and acutally finishing it due to the specific requirements and learning the gitignore file. I got to meet a first partner in this class, and he really had a solid understanding about the cache which I did not have a good understanding. I really appreaciated his comprehension on this project when we started, because he helped me start this project with good understanding and work more efficiently.
    
## What's in your way?
Nothing is really in my way except for my laziness and a lack of commitment to study for now.
    
## What will you do next week?
I will try to do prject early and do the readings and continue to focus during the class.

## Experience in the class
Even though I really like the class, I knew the interactive style of class would make me uncomfortable sometime and that happened this week. I could not understand the explanation about Netflix much during the class and could not answer a really simple question which was embarassing. I will try to focus more and perhaps understand what is going on in class better next time.
    
## Pick or Tip of the week
I do not have much tips to tell about, but I did pick up an article to read every week and it is the one below. The beginning part describes about how business skill is needed for the computer analyst to follow the trend and and how hard the difficulty of finding those people are. I already knew about that studying the business would benefit a lot, but this article just reminded me the importance of the business skill in the industry.
