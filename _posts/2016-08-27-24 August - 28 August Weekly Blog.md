## What did you do this past week?
This past week I went to California with my family. This was my first trip since I immigrated into America so it was exciting to go with my family. Besides the trip, this whole summer has been just moving-in moving-out for my parents' house and my apartments in Austin. I am glad that I have finally settled on one place after moving stuffs so many times this summer.
## What's in your way?
So far nothing is in my way other than my laziness that dwindles my motivation to do assignments and others. I hope I will be able to push myself further this year to achieve the goals in my mind.
    
## What will you do next week?
Next week, I will try to bring myself into focus on the assignments and the classes. I am little worried about taking 3 computer science classes for first time in UT, so I hope I will be able to overcome this semester with good result. I will also try to visit some organizations as much as possible to experience different stuffs more.
    
## Pick or Tip of the week
I do not have any relevant informations related to software development, so I will try to pick up some of software related articles next week, and now that is my plan for next week!

I took Professor Downing's Software Engineering class this summer, and I strongly recommend to do this blog for an extra credit! This is very easy and somewhat fun extra credit compared to anything else in my opinion.
