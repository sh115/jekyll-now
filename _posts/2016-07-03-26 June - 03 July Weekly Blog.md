## What did you do this past week?
We had a first exam in this class and it went pretty normal for me. I wished I would have practiced more general classes and functions. I wrote the functions and classes that were not on the test, so I regretted for not practicing the general stuffs like map and reduce. We had the guests from the company who were the alumni of UT, and it was nice listening to these guys talking about the real development with different tools. 

## What's in your way?
With a new project involving a lot of people in a group and the number of tools that we need to get familiarized are really hard to manage and understand. As for the group, it was hard to what each person would do at first, but at least most of members found the task to do and the slack application indeed made our communications better. Although, entering the group name every single time to log in is little hassle to do. As for the projects, I could not understand at all and still do not have full comprehension on how this would work and how much of work I have done exactly. Hopefully, I will be able to understand better as I go as soon as possible and be able to do my task successfully.
    
## What will you do next week?
I will be doing the project and next project. Other than the life of doing only project, I will be moving out my stuffs in the apartment. Because my family in Dallas is also moving out to different place, I had to move out mine a month early. So I am really sad about living without any furniture and monitor for a month.

   
## Pick or Tip of the week
This article talks about the readability of the code and how this author realized the importance of it is. I really agree that writing code in readable way or in beautiful way is a key especially if you are working with others. Last semester, I had a member who had a really good habit of adding comments and styles. My group and I had a good looking code most of times and I realized this when I switched the group with the codes that I previously used. My new group told me how easy it was to follow with my comments and felt rewarding with my good habits.
