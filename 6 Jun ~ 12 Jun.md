### What did you do this past week?
This past week I have been experiencing the new stuffs. This is the first summer to spend in Austin, so it is really nice to experience the humid weather which I have not experienced for recent years. I have also started the work in the library which allows me to study and focus on the class. So, this week has been learning what I would pretty much do for next eight weeks, and so far I am enjoying it.
    
### What's in your way?
There is not any external obstacles that get in my way, but I would like to schedule myself better and spend the time more wisely during this summer.
    
### What will you do next week?
 I will try my best to follow my planned schedule and accomplish what I am hoping.

### Experience in the class
Professor Downing's class is amazing! Even though I am struggling on the quizzes, but I really enjoy listening to his lecture and interactive class. He is the one of best lecturer I have experienced in UT so far. His policy of making people put away the laptops and the cell phones undoubtely forced me to concentrate during the class more.
    
### Pick-of-the-week
I do not have any relevant informations related to software development, so I will try to pick up some of software related articles next week, and now that is my plan for next week!
